    <h1>Three happy things</h1>
    <p> 
    

My biggest happiness in life is you, my people,<br>

And if my people live, it means that I live too.<br>

I give the honey of my poems to my nation<br>

This simple happiness means more than gold to me.<br> <br>

My second happiness is you, my dear native tongue,<br>

The hard stone granite heart I melted with the words,<br>

And all because I always learn from my native tongue,<br>

That taught me all the truth and kindness in the world.<br><br>

And my third happiness is you, my dear Motherland,<br>

Whoever stands for different things in life, and I will stand for you,<br>

Could an extinguished home fire be lit again?<br>

Come here, my friend and I will share my fire with you.<br><br>

Three things of happiness lie there on my caring palms,<br>

I am the richest man and no one would deny,<br>

Like bright three suns in the cloudless sky are shining,<br>

And underneath are Atyrau, Alatau and Altai!<br>
